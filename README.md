# SpeedyDelivery
This is a fun little project I undertook where I wanted to create a sort of pizza delivery game. This reminds me of an old arcade
game that I really enjoyed called Crazy Taxi. This is different in that it is a top down view, similar to that of the early GTA
titles. I learned a lot during this and I would like to continue to work on it.
